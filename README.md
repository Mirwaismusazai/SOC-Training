## My Experience:

As an aspiring SOC analyst, I was genuinely excited to complete TryHackMeâ€™s dedicated training for the role. The course provided a comprehensive overview of industry tools and frameworks, giving me the chance to explore and gain hands-on experience with many I had never used before. Working with SIEMs, Wireshark, and Snort was both exciting and expected, but what stood out the most was diving into lesser-known tools like Autopsy, Zeek, and OSquery. It was a great experience stepping out of my comfort zone and learning to navigate new security tools that are essential in the field.
